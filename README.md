1.target user profile----

This curriculum is intended for individuals responsible for hiring personnel in companies in the video game development sector to find workers who meet their requirements and fit the positions they are looking for.

In this case, it's a fictional resume about me, consisting of information about my qualifications, education, skills, and some personal information to make it easier for hiring managers to consider my profile and potentially become interested in my candidacy.




2.information architecture----

Firstly, I've attached a photo so you can get to know me better. However, in this case, it's not an actual photo of me but a design. The truth is, I'm not convinced about the idea of including a photo because I feel that it could lead to immediate dismissal based on physical appearance, which is discriminatory. I've added it because this is a project, and appearance doesn't matter here.

Secondly, right below, I've attached various ways for you to reach out to me, along with a sort description about myself.

Afterwards, I've included all the relevant information about my education, knowledge, and skills that could be beneficial for the role I'm applying for.



3.visual design----

The truth is, I haven't quite felt completely comfortable with the visual design of my resume. I've decided to go for something simple, concise, and to the point, without beating around the bush. I've also designed it in a way that I can expand it in the future without making major changes, just by adding more text.

I'm not a design expert, and I believe I could have created something more interesting. Likewise, focusing on the design, I've placed the contact details just below my photo, along with a logo for easier recognition. I've positioned them at the top for easy access. Following that, I've introduced the content separated into sections to prevent any confusion and to make the content more visually appealing.
